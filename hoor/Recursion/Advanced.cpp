//recursive tree: is a tree that represents the recursive calls of a function
//nodes of the tree are the function calls
//edges of the tree are the recursive calls
//time complexity of the function is the number of nodes in the tree

//Basic Strucute of a recursive tree:
//1. root node: represents the initial function call
//2. leaf nodes: represents the base case
//3. internal nodes: represents the recursive calls
//4. process the result
